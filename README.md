It is a simulator for the PIPPIN computer, that will allow the user to compile and excecute code written
in the PIPPIN format. 

To run:

    Download JAR and run either by double click or:
     java -jar PIPPIN_Sim.jar

    Download one of the files from the PIPPIN Tests directory.
        Some of the files were meant to include errors, 
        however the Factorial7, Factorial7Indirect and QSort should work correctly.
